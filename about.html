                <h2 class="headers">My story</h2>
                <p>I began my journey of healing at thirteen when I developed a serious shoulder injury from over
                    training.
                    I was a competitive swimmer from a very young age, eventually stopping due to my shoulder injury. I
                    attributed my sense of self, safety, and belonging to success in the pool. Hello root chakra
                    imbalance!

                    My wonderful coach and founder of my team suggested I go to yoga for additional shoulder support. I
                    was
                    resistant at the beginning. I found the pace of practice, the focus on breathing, the stretching
                    almost
                    unbearable. The practice did not match the pace of my fast chaotic speedy mind. I struggled to
                    connect,
                    and for some reason I kept going back.

                    Over time, with continued practice and integration, I developed an ever evolving love for Yoga,
                    breath
                    work, meditation, Bhakti, and much more. I have been practicing yoga for over a decade. I have taken
                    a
                    variety of training in Yin YTT (50+ hrs), Ayurvedic Coach & Ayurveda training (75+ hrs), Vinyasa YTT
                    (200+ hrs), Holy Fire Reiki level I and II and more! I am currently taking a year-long advanced
                    Ayurveda
                    course with the Shakti School as well as a 7 week course: Redesigning the Self, the Road to
                    Transcendence with Muktananda. I am also finishing my Bachelors degree at Boston College.

                    I love to learn. I am always jumping on more opportunities to learn wherever I can. In the future I
                    look
                    to continue my journey learning and connecting, studying to become a Tantric Priestess, and
                    eventually
                    starting a healing center.

                    I am a modern day light healer. I work with beings to help them discover their genuine most powerful
                    selves. Through energy work: reiki, individual nutrition coaching, and breath work I help your body
                    alchemize, move energy, and enter deeply into the safety of your skin.

                    My early years involved sexual trauma, family trauma, and an unstable life of addition and
                    disacossiation. I was diagnosed with complex PTSD, anxiety, and depression in high school and found
                    myself causing chaos wherever I went. I share this because, as a modern day healer, I hope to be
                    relatable to you. I hope you see yourself in me. I am Portuguese American. I currently live in South
                    Florida.

                    Thank you for being a miracle and finding your way to this sanctuary of healing. I'd love to get to
                    know
                    you deeper.</p>
